# Design Document

## Overview

Toluwanimi Odunewu's AI/ML Engineer + Product Manager portfolio will be built as a modern, responsive multi-page application showcasing expertise across two domains: AI/ML Engineering and AI Product Management. The design emphasizes professional presentation of technical projects and product documentation while maintaining optimal performance for GitHub Pages hosting. The site features dedicated pages for each project category with detailed project views including PRDs, demos, use cases, and performance metrics for product management projects.

## Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3 (with CSS Grid and Flexbox), Vanilla JavaScript
- **Build Process**: Simple static site generation compatible with GitHub Pages
- **Hosting**: GitHub Pages with automatic deployment via GitHub Actions
- **Styling**: Custom CSS with CSS variables for theming, no external frameworks to minimize dependencies
- **Icons**: SVG icons for scalability and performance

## Error Handling

### Image Loading
- Implement fallback images for missing project screenshots
- Progressive image loading with blur-to-sharp transitions
- Error states for failed image loads

### Form Submission
- Client-side validation with clear error messages
- Network error handling with retry mechanisms
- Success confirmation with clear next steps

### Performance Fallbacks
- Graceful degradation for older browsers
- Reduced motion preferences respect
- Offline-first approach where possible

## Testing Strategy

### Manual Testing
- Cross-browser compatibility testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Mobile device testing across different screen sizes
- Accessibility testing with screen readers
- Performance testing with Lighthouse

### Automated Testing
- HTML validation using W3C validator
- CSS validation and linting
- JavaScript linting with ESLint
- Automated accessibility testing with axe-core

### Performance Optimization
- Image optimization and compression
- CSS and JavaScript minification
- Critical CSS inlining
- Lazy loading implementation for non-critical resources

## Responsive Design Strategy

### Breakpoints
- Mobile: 320px - 768px
- Tablet: 768px - 1024px  
- Desktop: 1024px+

### Layout Adaptations
- Mobile-first CSS approach
- Flexible grid systems using CSS Grid and Flexbox
- Scalable typography using clamp() functions
- Touch-friendly interactive elements (minimum 44px touch targets)

## GitHub Pages Integration

### Deployment Strategy
- Automatic deployment via GitHub Actions on push to main branch
- Custom domain support with HTTPS
- SEO optimization with meta tags and structured data
- Sitemap generation for search engine indexing

### Content Management
- JSON-based data files for easy content updates
- Markdown support for long-form content
- Version control for all content changes
- Branch-based workflow for content updates

## Security Considerations

### Form Security
- Client-side input sanitization
- HTTPS enforcement for all communications
- Third-party form service integration (Formspree/Netlify Forms)
- Spam protection mechanisms

### Asset Security
- Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
- Secure external resource loading
- Image optimization without metadata exposure
